# Description



This project will create a random password using criteria selected by the user. It will iclude a series of window prompts asking how long the password should be, and which criteria to include. The generated password will be displayed in the box to be copied.

## What I've learned

During this project I've learned a significant amount about JavaScript, for-loops, and functions.
